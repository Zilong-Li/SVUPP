* Spreadsheet for samples

The [[file:samples.csv]] file shows an example of the spreadsheet for configuring samples, which includes six mandatory columns named ="batch,sample,bam,bai,fasta,fai"=.

* Spreadsheet for reference panels

A reference panel means the VCF file with phased genotypes for a group of individuals in a population.

The [[file:refpanel.csv]] file shows an example of the spreadsheet for configuring a reference panel, which includes four mandatory columns named ="chrom,genetic_map,vcf,vcf_index"=. Note that both VCF and BCF files are accepted.

You can download the reference panel from the 1000 Genomes Project  https://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage/working/20201028_3202_phased and download the genetic map from QUILT's website https://github.com/rwdavies/QUILT/tree/master/maps.

Alternatively, you can directly download the prepared 1000 Genomes reference panel in RData format for QUILT2 here http://popgen.dk/zilong/datahub/1KGP/quilt2_refpanel_hg38/RData/ along with a spreadsheet such as http://popgen.dk/zilong/datahub/1KGP/quilt2_refpanel_hg38/prepared_reference_rdata.csv.

* Spreadsheet for read labels 

The [[file:samples_read_labels.csv]] file shows an example of the spreadsheet for configuring the read labels for each sample, which includes two mandatory columns named ="sample,label"=, where label points to a text file that stores the reads /qname,phasing_prob,hap/.

* Spreadsheet for prepared reference panel 

The [[file:prepared_reference_rdata.csv]] file shows an example of the spreadsheet for configuring already prepared reference panel in R data structure used by QUILT2, which includes two mandatory columns named ="chunk_id,refpanel_rdata"=, where =refpanel_rdata= points to the RData file that was generated by QUILT2_preprare_reference.R
